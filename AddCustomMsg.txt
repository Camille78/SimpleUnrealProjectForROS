## How too create custom messages ?

The plugin includes all standard ROS msgs.
However if you want to use custom messages, rosserial_client package includes a tool for generating the required header files from message definition files.

Please perform the following steps.

To add new messages to the library you have to delete (if already created) the whole ros_lib folder in your ros project workspace and generate all from scratch. 

Remove the ros_lib folder : rm -r ~/yourRosProject/workspace/ros_lib
Generate the folder : rosrun rosserial_windows make_libraries.py ~/yourRosProject/workspace


Then copy/paste the ros_lib folder into the plugin ~/Unreal-ros-plugin/ThirdParty/
